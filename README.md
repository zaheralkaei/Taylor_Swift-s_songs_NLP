# Taylor Swift's songs NLP

This project analyzes the lyrics of Taylor Swift’s songs using natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis. The dataset comes from this open Kaggle source (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tksmax/taylorswiftlyrics/data), with an added column for the year of release. For songs that were re-released (like in her "Taylor’s Version" albums), the newer release year was used.
